## Inspiration
- As easy as CourseUp makes it to plan individual semesters, it lacks the ability to plan out your degree.

## What it does
- The Course Planner allows you to schedule your CSC degree from day one. Add courses to your timetable, remove them, or edit it later on.

## How we built it
- We designed The Course Planner in Figma then translated it to a web app.

## Challenges we ran into
- I'm not super familiar with react so managing state was sometimes challenging. Finding courses was hard because the API isn't working :(

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We managed to get a functional project done in one day!

## What we learned
- Things are always more challenging to implement than to plan...

## What's next for The Course Planner
- It would be really nice to access the CourseUp API and be able to select program planning worksheets for any program.
